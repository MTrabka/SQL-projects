Modify your previous query to select only the most important columns in order to display a log of reviews by selecting the following:

From the places table: name, average_rating
From the reviews table: username, rating, review_date, note*/

Now write a query to do a LEFT JOIN on the tables, selecting the same columns as the previous question.

How are the results of this query different? Would this or the INNER JOIN be more useful for a log of reviews?*/
