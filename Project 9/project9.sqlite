/* TASK 4 It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:

How many money_in transactions are in this table?  43
How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency? 21*/

SELECT MAX(money_in), MAX(money_out) FROM transactions;

-- TASK 6 What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)? 131.888888888889

SELECT AVG(money_in) FROM transactions
WHERE currency='ETH';

-- TASK 7 Let’s build a ledger for the different dates.
-- Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table. And group everything by date.

SELECT date, AVG(money_in), AVG(money_out) FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;

-- TASK 8 To make the previous query easier to read, round the averages to 2 decimal places. Give the column aliases using AS for readability.

SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(money_in),2) AS 'Average Money In', ROUND(AVG(money_out),2) AS 'Average Money Out' FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
