/* TASK 7 CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings in the project, which should they pick and why?*/

/* CoolTShirts should re-invest in these 5 campaigns:

Paid Search (Google) – best conversion rate, people who search are ready to buy.

Weekly Newsletter (Email) – brings the highest number of purchases.

Retargeting Ad (Facebook) – very good at bringing back visitors to finish buying.

Retargeting Campaign (Email) – also strong in closing sales.

Buzzfeed Article (10 Crazy Cool T-Shirts Facts) – from the content campaigns, this one converts the best.

The first four campaigns bring almost all purchases (over 90%) and have strong conversion rates. We also keep one article campaign to attract new people at the top of the funnel.*/
