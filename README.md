# SQL Course Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the **Analyze Data with SQL** Skill Path on Codecademy.  
It documents my progress in learning SQL for data analysis, database management, and query optimization.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **Project 1 â€“ Create a Table**: practice with table creation, data insertion, updating, altering schema, and deletion.  
- **Project 2 â€“ New York Restaurants**: data exploration and analysis using filtering, sorting, and conditional logic.  
- **Upcoming Projects**: more case studies and exercises will be added as I advance through the course.  

## ðŸš€ Projects

### Project 1: Create a Table
In this project, I created a simple **friends** table and practiced basic SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, altering tables, and deleting rows.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`  
- `UPDATE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DELETE`

### Project 2: New York Restaurants
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of New York City restaurants stored in a table called **nomnom**.  
The goal was to practice writing SQL queries to explore the data and answer specific business questions.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- `SELECT DISTINCT`  
- Filtering with `WHERE` (including `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`)  
- Handling missing values (`IS NULL`)  
- Sorting and limiting results (`ORDER BY ... LIMIT`)  
- Using `CASE` for conditional logic in queries
