In this project, I analyzed employee and project data for **Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc.** to ensure projects can be staffed efficiently.  
Each project requires a Project Manager, Team Lead, Designer, DBA, and **at least two Developers**. I explored who hasn‚Äôt chosen a project, which projects lack staff, which projects attract the most employees, and whether we have enough developers.  
As a bonus, I used Myers‚ÄìBriggs personality rules to surface the most common personality, see which projects they prefer, and compute‚Äîper employee‚Äîthe number of incompatible co-workers.

- Table exploration and schema reasoning  
- Joins for staffing insights (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)  
- Anti-joins with subqueries (`NOT IN`)  
- Aggregations and grouping (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`)  
- Headcount math with scalar subqueries (e.g., developer slots per project)  
- Conditional logic with `CASE` and subqueries to apply compatibility rules

### Project 14: Codeflix Churn Rate

In this project, I analyzed subscription data for **Codeflix**, a streaming startup that wanted to measure early churn rates across different marketing segments.  
The dataset (`subscriptions` table) contained the following fields:
- `id` ‚Äì subscription ID  
- `subscription_start` ‚Äì start date of the subscription  
- `subscription_end` ‚Äì end date of the subscription (nullable if still active)  
- `segment` ‚Äì acquisition channel (two groups: 87 and 30)  

The goal was to calculate monthly churn rates during the first three months of 2017, compare them across the two segments, and determine which group had lower churn.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Data exploration (`SELECT ... LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`)  
- Date range analysis with `MIN` and `MAX`  
- Building a temporary months table  
- `CROSS JOIN` to combine subscriptions with each month  
- Using `CASE WHEN` to flag active and canceled subscriptions by segment  
- Aggregating with `SUM` to calculate totals per month  
- Computing churn rates (`canceled √∑ active`)  
- Comparing churn trends across segments over time
