## ðŸš€ Projects

### Project 1: Create a Table
In this project, I created a simple **friends** table and practiced basic SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, altering tables, and deleting rows.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`  
- `UPDATE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DELETE`

### Project 2: New York Restaurants
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of New York City restaurants stored in a table called **nomnom**.  
The goal was to practice writing SQL queries to explore the data and answer specific business questions.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- `SELECT DISTINCT`  
- Filtering with `WHERE` (including `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`)  
- Handling missing values (`IS NULL`)  
- Sorting and limiting results (`ORDER BY ... LIMIT`)  
- Using `CASE` for conditional logic in queries

### Project 3: RPA Fraud Detection

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of credit card transactions (`transaction_data`) to help the finance department identify potentially fraudulent activity.  
The main goal was to practice filtering, pattern matching, and working with real-world fraud detection scenarios.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- Data exploration (`SELECT * ... LIMIT`)  
- Conditional filtering with `WHERE`  
- Pattern matching with `LIKE` and wildcards  
- Filtering by domain (email checks with `LIKE '%@temp_email.com'`)  
- Identifying anomalies in data (ZIP codes, IP ranges)

### Project 4: RPA Customer Segmentation

In this project, I worked with a dataset of users (`users` table) to generate marketing segments for the company.  
Segments are subsets of users that meet different conditions and can be used for targeted campaigns.  

**Skills Practiced:**
- Date filtering with `BETWEEN` and comparison operators  
- Working with `created_at` timestamps  
- Using `LIKE` for pattern matching  
- Segmenting data with multiple conditions  
- Table modification (`ALTER TABLE`) and updating records (`UPDATE ... SET`)  
- Calculating derived values (age at signup) using `strftime()`

### Project 5: Davieâ€™s Burgers Subway Ad

In this project, I explored the **orders** data for Davieâ€™s Burgers to uncover fun, ad-worthy insights for a subway campaign.  
The focus was on finding memorable facts (best-selling items, peak hours, quirky combos) that could inspire a catchy tagline.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Aggregations and ranking (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)
- Time bucketing and date functions (hour/day-of-week extraction)
- Text/pattern work for item names and modifiers
- Basic segmentation (by hour, weekday, item category)
- (Optional) pairs/combos analysis and simple window functions

### Project 6: Trends in Startups

In this project, I explored a dataset of startups to calculate key statistics and practice SQL aggregations.  
The table contained information such as company name, category, location, number of employees, valuation, amount raised, and founding year.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)  
- Grouping and filtering with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`  
- Applying conditions within aggregate queries

### Project 7: The Metropolitan Museum of Art

In this project, I explored artwork data from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  
The goal was to practice filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to uncover insights about the collection.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `MIN`)  
- String matching with `LIKE`  
- Grouping and filtering (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)  
- Ordering and limiting results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)  
- Conditional grouping using `CASE`
